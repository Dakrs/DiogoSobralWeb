      "I'm a senior at the University of Minho currently undertaking a computer science master. In the past year, I specialized in Distributed Systems and High-Performance Computing. One of my passion is studying new algorithms and making implementations that take the most of the available resources. While choosing my thesis subject, I considered this, and I am developing a consensus algorithm implementation using both Disk Paxos and SPDK (a high-performance toolkit for remote disk access).",
      "Since I was a kid, my parents always encouraged me to have good grades. I have been at the top of my classes since I can remember, although when I was in my third year of college I figured out that grades are not everything and decided to developed other soft-skills. I joined an organization called UDREAM, which taught me how to be a better version of myself and to empower others around me. Since then, I have been focusing on improving leadership skills and actively participated in programs that forced me to be in distinct environments and to meet different persons."
